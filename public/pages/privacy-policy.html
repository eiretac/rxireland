        <p>If you are from the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for processing personal information depends on the information we collect and the context in which we collect it. We may process your personal data because:</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
        <p>Our Site is not intended for children under 13 years old, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13 without verified parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

        <h2>Your Data Protection Rights (GDPR)</h2>

            <li>The right to object to or restrict processing of your data</li>
            <li>The right to data portability</li>
            <li>The right to withdraw consent at any time where we rely on your consent to process your personal data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
